- Added a "Download Assets button to shared links. This will download all of the individual files which make up the final video. Can be enabled in Settings > General.
- Fixed bug in editor, where it would sometimes not use current project settings for shareable links.
- Fixed another artifact issue (black/white, flickering) when recording from 1080p monitors.
